## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🎧 Story2Audio
A gRPC-based microservice that converts user-provided text into audio narration using the ParlerTTS Jenny model. Includes validation, concurrency handling, and API support.

➡️ [View Project](./story2audio)

---

### 🧪 Optimized_MLpipeline
An optimized machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization. Emphasizes modularity and code efficiency.

➡️ [View Project](./Optimized_MLpipeline)

---

### 🫁 Pneumonia_Prediction
Deep learning model (e.g., CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Uses standard datasets and visual explanation techniques (like Grad-CAM).

➡️ [View Project](./Pneumonia_Prediction)

---

### 🔍 Research and Implementation
A compilation of research-based coding experiments and implementations, likely aligned with course-based and publication-support work.

➡️ [View Project](./Research and implementation)

---

### 🚦 Traffic Sign Classification
A classical digital image processing–based system to detect and classify traffic signs. The project uses color segmentation, contour detection, and feature extraction techniques instead of deep learning, making it lightweight and suitable for resource-constrained environments.

---

### 🗃 VendorCorp
A functional website with an interactive dashboard and a proper SQL + Node.js backend for handling vendor data. The project uses Node.js, SQL, HTML, and CSS, and supports real-time interactions for managing vendor operations through a clean UI.

➡️ [View Project](./VendorCorp_Website)

---

### ✈️ FlightDelay_Pred
A machine learning project to predict flight delays using flight schedules, weather data, and airline metadata. It covers data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and uses models like Random Forest and XGBoost to classify delays. Ideal for practical predictive modeling.
